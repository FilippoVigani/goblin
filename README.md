# Goblin

Goblin is an IOT project to control my green iguana's enclosure lights and sensors (temperature and humidity).

The interface allows you to control the status of the various relay switches of an ad-hoc custom made power strip either based on time-slices or based on the temperature of specific sensors.

Backend written in Python with a Flask server running on my raspberry pi.
